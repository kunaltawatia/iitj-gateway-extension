A chrome extension (other browsers underway) that helps you automate the process of logging in the Forticlient Gateway used by the intranet administration of IIT Jodhpur.

## Description
We are all fed up of logging in everytime we open our laptops. I don't think we need a description.

## Development 

This is a bare minimal extension. Follow the steps [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#unpacked) to load the unpacked extension and start local development.
